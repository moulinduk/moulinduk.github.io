          Since my schooldays, when I learned about Pyramids in my history books, I had the desire to visit them. However that 
          time, I could not think about any international trips because of the high expenses and lack of ideas regarding passport, 
          visa and all. I could not imagine that this desire will be fulfilled in my first international journey and that also at 
          no extra cost. I received a research internship offer in summer 2023, for which I had to travel to Canada. I had a daylong 
          layover at Cairo (the capital of Egypt). This small trip is the result of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          While searching for flights from various Indian airports to Toronto (in Canada), I found a very cheap round trip flight of Egyptair 
          from Mumbai which has a 22 hour layover at Cairo. I searched on Youtube if someone travelled before in this route and I was amazed 
          to see that a lot of people did that already. Also the airline doesn't only allow passengers to enter the country visafree but also 
          arranges for accommodation and food at a five-star hotel near airport free of cost. I informed this to my other friends who were also 
          going to Canada. My two classmates Samanwaya Patra and Nirankush Roy immediately became interested. We did few more researches before 
          finally booking the ticket. On 5 May 2023 at 3 AM in the midnight, our first flight would leave from Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 
          international airport (BOM) and land at Cairo international airport (CAI) Around 6.30 AM (in Egypt clock). Our flight to Toronto 
          Pearson international airport (YYZ) will be at 7 AM on the next day. So, we would have the full day for the trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the scheduled day, we reached the Mumbai airport. I was very excited because this was my first international journey. We landed at 
          Cairo around 5 AM local time (2.5 hours behind India's time). The airline took our passport and boarding pass of next flight; and
          made us sit in the international waiting area for around two hours. After that they took us through immigration (through a side gate, 
          lol) and then to Hotel Le Passage, a five-star hotel near the airport. Meanwhile at airport we, five students, booked a car for the day
          at only USD $10 per person (thanks to Samanwaya, who was carrying some USD cash). The rooms were double sharing. I shared a room with a
          Gujarati student. We took shower, had breakfast in the dining area and a little rest before starting our day trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 12 PM, all five of us came out of hotel to start our journey. The our car was booked for six hours. Within that period
          we can go wherever we wish. As obvious, we first decided to go to the Pyramids. In an hour we reached there meanwhile crossing the
          longest river Nile in between. As we were aware of the scams there, we decided not to ride on camels. Still we were almost getting 
          forced to ride. Anyway finally we were free and decided to roam around the garden in our own way. Here let me also mention the costs. 
          For an adult entry ticket to the garden is 240 EGP and entry to each pyramid interior is 440 EGP. We took the student tickets (of half 
          fare) for the garden and the Khufu Pyramid (largest in the world) interior. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The area is quite huge and it is really hard to cover everything in a day by walking unless you start very early. Fortunately Khufu 
          pyramid was the nearest one. Still it took more than three hours to visit the Sphinx and the interior of Khufu. We took a lot of photos
          and bought some souvenirs there. Also it took a good amount of time to find our car (the earlier car left and a new one was arranged).
          Finally we barely had enough time to visit anything else. We had plan of visiting the Egyptian Museum, but by the time we reached there, 
          it was already closed. There was a muslim student in our group, who wanted to visit the Al-Hussein Mosque (believed to contain the head of 
          Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad), a pilgrimage place for them. While he visited there along with the driver, Samanwaya
          and Nirankush went to a taste some local cuisine called Koshari. Finally we returned to hotel and had our dinner. Then we settled our 
          expenses, which was little funny involving four currencies (INR, EGP, CAD and USD). Then we took nice rest at night before continuing 
          our upcoming long journey towards Canada next morning.
